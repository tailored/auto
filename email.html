    <b>Please read this entire email!</b><br>
    <br>
    For your protection, we recommend any purchases made through 
contacts on our website or any other, be made by check, check by phone, 
credit card or COD only. Never wire money through your bank
    account or Western Union to make a purchase from someone you don't 
know.<br>
    <br>
    <b>This is how it works so you will know what to expect:</b><br>
    <br>
    1. You filled out the form and submitted your part request.<br>
    2. You were given the option to pay $6.99 to have the request 
answered within 48 hours or $9.99 to have it answered within 24 hours or
 less. (If no one is able to supply you with the part please
    email us and let us know so that we can issue you a refund as 
promised)<br>
    3. The request is sent via email to our nationwide network of Vendors.<br>
    4. If your part is available then one or more of the Vendors will 
contact you by phone or email with the price and warranty that is 
available for your part.<br>
    5. The last step is for you to order your part from your Auto 
Recycler of choice and have it shipped directly to you or your mechanic.
 If you are not happy with the price or warranty you are
    never under any obligation to make a purchase from any of them.<br>
    <br>
    The request is sent one time, and does not go on a list. Therefore 
there is no need to send an e-mail asking to be removed from a list.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Please note:</b> You may get some auto responses from some of the
 suppliers. Please understand that this in no way counts as us finding 
your part. If one of the Vendors can not actually offer
    you the part that you requested then you are entitled to a refund 
for any locating fee that you may have paid.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Watch your Email Inbox for responses!</b><br>
    <br>
    No more wasting time searching for your part. We give you choices. 
Some have better prices. Some have better warranties and Some have both.
 It is your choice. You can feel secure that we keep
    your information strictly confidential and it is never shared with 
anyone outside of our own network.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We are here to help you with all your part needs. If you are not 
satisfied with our service please email us so we can try and help you 
with any issues or concerns that you may have.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
